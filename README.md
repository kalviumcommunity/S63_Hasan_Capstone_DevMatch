Capstone Project Proposal: DevMatch

Problem Statement:

Finding the right collaborator is challenging. Many developers struggle
to connect with like-minded peers who share their tech stack, interests,
and goals. Existing platforms such as LinkedIn, Discord, and Reddit lack
an efficient way to match developers based on preferences and project
needs. There is a need for a platform that allows developers to find
suitable teammates based on their skills and interests without the
complexities of traditional networking.



Solution:

This platform aims to provide developers with an easy way to
discover and collaborate on projects. Unlike traditional job
boards or networking sites, this platform focuses on project-
based connections, allowing users to browse projects, express
interest, and connect with other developers. The matchmaking
feature is available but optional, ensuring flexibility in how users
engage.



Key Features:

Profile Creation – Users create profiles specifying their skills, interests, and
project preferences.
Project Posting &amp; Discovery – Users can post projects with detailed
descriptions and required skill sets, allowing interested developers to apply.
Interest-Based Matching – Developers can indicate interest in projects and
get connected to project owners.
Optional Mutual Matching – Users can browse developer profiles and
match if both parties express interest.
Tech Tags &amp; Filters – Match projects and developers based on programming
languages, experience, and availability.
Chat &amp; Collaboration Tools – In-app messaging for project discussions and
Planning.



Tech Stack:

• Frontend: React
• Backend: Node.js with Express
• Database: MongoDB (for storing profiles, projects, and matches)
• Authentication: Firebase/Auth0
• Matching Logic: Custom algorithm based on skills, project
interests, and mutual preferences
• Chat System: Socket.io or Firebase Realtime Database



Target Audience:

• Students looking for hackathon teammates or academic project
partners.
• Freelancers seeking collaborators for client projects.
• Startup Founders in need of technical co-founders or
development teams.
• Open Source Enthusiasts who want to contribute to projects and
grow their skills.



Expected Outcome:

A dedicated platform for developers to efficiently find and
collaborate on projects. By streamlining project discovery and
team formation, the platform will enhance productivity, foster
innovation, and create a strong developer community focused
on real-world applications and teamwork.
